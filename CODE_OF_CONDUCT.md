# What is a Good Design

This document outlines principles for designing and maintaining a well-structured, maintainable, and understandable codebase. It emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and effective problem-solving strategies.
    _"I know it when I see it."_ - Potter Stewart

## Aesthetics and Organization

* Readability: Prioritize clear, descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary complexity for the sake of aesthetics.
* Consistency: Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.
* Modular Design: Break down the codebase into well-defined modules with minimal dependencies. Avoid overly complex folder structures based solely on material types.

    _"A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds"_ - Ralph Waldo Emerson

    __Remember, consistency is important, but it shouldn't hinder logical organization.__

## The Principle of Least Astonishment

* Intuitive Behavior: Functions and methods should behave predictably. Arguments should appear in a logical order, with the most common options readily accessible.
Simplicity
* Leverage Native Types: When possible, utilize the language's native data types instead of creating custom objects for every scenario.
* Focus on Core Functionality: Concentrate on solving the core problem with minimal extra features. Edge cases can be addressed later as needed.

    _"Make the easy jobs easy, and the hard jobs possible."_ - Larry Wall

    __Focus on making the core functionality clear and efficient.__

## Avoiding Overgeneralization

* Balance Specificity and Flexibility: Design your code to be adaptable without introducing unnecessary complexity. Consider the "Goldilocks zone" - not too specific, not too general.
Problem-Solving and Complexity Management
* Prioritization: Distinguish between essential and non-essential features. Address complexity by managing dependencies, state, and edge cases effectively.
* Progressive Disclosure: Introduce functionalities gradually to avoid overwhelming users with options. Organize and expose elements thoughtfully.
* Separation of Concerns: Use abstractions to hide implementation details and improve maintainability.

    __Design is about refining abstractions to build upon them, while engineering focuses on implementation.__

## Dependencies

* Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Organize dependencies in a way that avoids circular references. Consider using dependency managers for complex scenarios.
* Dependency Injection: When possible, pass dependencies as function arguments for better testability and reduced coupling.

### Dependencies are unavoidable, but how you handle them matters.

* Hardcoded vs. Injected: Dependencies can be tightly coupled to the code (hardcoded) or passed in as parameters (injected).
* Discovery as an Option: In some cases, frameworks can discover dependencies automatically.

### Dependency injection promotes separation of concerns.

* Cohesion vs. Coupling:
    * Cohesion: How well-related functionalities are within a module (higher is better).
    * Coupling: How interconnected modules are (lower is better).
* The Litmus Test: A well-decoupled design is usually both cohesive and easier to test.

    __Avoid over-generic code in pursuit of reusability. Focus on solving specific problems effectively.__

### Containers, An alternative solution for complex dependency management is a container.

* Containers: Functions or classes responsible for orchestrating object creation, composition, and injection. Similar to pytest's fixture interface.
* Configuration-Driven: Containers can be configured explicitly (e.g., schema) or implicitly (e.g., signatures).
Consider the trade-offs between containers and dependency injection for your specific needs.

## Generalizing to State

* State management adds complexity. Use it judiciously and consider decoupling complex state logic when necessary.

    __Use it, but not lightly.__

## Edge Cases

* Focus on Common Scenarios: Prioritize clear and reliable behavior for typical use cases. Handle edge cases explicitly and separately later as required.
* Fail Fast: Design your code to identify and signal errors as quickly as possible.
* Simplicity and usability often trump completeness (and even correctness!)

    __Prioritize a clear and usable interface over absolute edge case coverage.__

## Cognitive Load

* Organize Options Intuitively: Group options in a natural hierarchy, placing frequently used elements prominently.
* Composition over Inheritance: Favor code composition to distribute functionality and reduce cognitive load for developers.

    __Focus on clear and well-defined interfaces for both users and developers.__

## Multipurposeness

* Modular vs. Monolithic Systems: Evaluate whether a modular or monolithic architecture is better suited for the project's needs. Consider the trade-off between simplicity of interfaces and separation of responsibilities (Single Responsibility Principle).

    __The "Goldilocks zone" applies here too - avoid overly generic or overly specific designs.__

## Simplicity

* The Unix Philosophy: Strive for a clear and concise interface like the Unix commands: open, close, read, write.

    _"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."_ - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

    _"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler"_ — Albert Einstein

    __Strive for simplicity, but avoid oversimplification; complexity is not always bad__
