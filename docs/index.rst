Welcome to brain-computer-interface's documentation!
====================================================

A brain-computer-interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between the brain's electrical activity and an external device, most commonly a computer or robotic limb; that's what this project is trying to. I know, crazy, but Elon will surly relate.
We assume, or hope, that one day we will have a hardware that connect to our brain. This project is the software layer on top of that supposed hardware.
